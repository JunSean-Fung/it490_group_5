Part of the project is our interest and part of the reason is because we have not seen or used a site where
it combines video game-related topics with crypto. This project will allow gamers and investors to utilize
the tools provided by the site to find information quickly. This project creates a sense of community that
unify both the gamers and investors virtually. Two of the hottest topics online seem to be Gaming and
Crypto. Instead of having the web surfers going to separate sites, we curate it as one stop shop for
gaming and crypto related trends and topics. This project will help build a community of enthusiasts alike
with our unique forum for others to discuss.
